# Yelp Search

This is a simple React app that allows you to search for restaurants on Yelp. It uses the Yelp Fusion API to fetch restaurant data based on search criteria.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to obtain an API key from Yelp. Here's how:

1. Go to the Yelp Fusion API documentation and create an account if you don't already have one.
2. Create a new Yelp app and obtain an API key.
3. Create a new file called `.env.local` in the root directory of this project. In `.env.example` file can be found environment variable needed
4. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
## Running the App

To run the app locally, simply run the following command: `npm start`

The app should be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Live Demo

You can view a live demo of the application [https://restaurants-app-two.vercel.app/](https://restaurants-app-two.vercel.app/).(If you click on the card and the page appears blank, it means that I have run out of daily API calls.)
